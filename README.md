My-Blog
=======

All the stuff for my personal blog.

## Phase 1

I'll be focusing on content first, this means until I have something valuable to give through my blog I'll be using "The Bootstrap Blog: The official example template of creating a blog with Bootstrap." which you can find here: http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/. After a couple articles are up, i'll begin playing with the presentation layer. I would like to turn this blog's desktop experience into something pretty. I have *a* plan so stay tuned.
